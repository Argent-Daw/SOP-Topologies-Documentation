# SOP: Backup and Restore Plan

## Purpose:

This SOP will outline how we will be backing up or restoring any data on our Ubuntu Linux Server. It will cover what we identify how we backup critical data and how to restore any data loss due to any system error or natrual causes. The process will ensure that we keep data integrity at the highest priority and maintain minimal data loss or downtime.

## Scope:

To standardize a method for data management by regular data backups and restoring methods for the Ubuntu Linux Server.

## Responsibilities:

The IT Department known as Argent Dawn is the sole custodian and primary authority for all maintenance and review of this policy letter.

## Prerequisites:

* Ubuntu Linux Server creation with Administrator Control
* Creation of backup storage methods
* Installation of all critical backup software
* Establish a data backup schedule


## Procedure:

The procedure will be implemented in a few step process: Disk and Restoration based. The utilization of disks can be added to all customer and employee storage decided. Backup data soltions will be for user data, server data and all other primary storage methods.

**Backup Methods**

1. What is Critical
* Identify what data for the company is critical for operations and day to to day functionality. Critical data needs to be backed up, this will include: all system configurations, employee user files, server files, and other identified relevant data.

2. Backup Schedule or Backup Type
* Daily Plan: We will perform a daily incremental backup of all data to capture crtitical data changes and user files
* Weekly Plan: We will perform a weekly full backup to capture a complete data copy of all data files
* Snapshots: Employees will have a backup solution implemented every few hours during the day so they can restore data from a restore point.

3. Validation
* The IT Department will ensure that regular testing is done for backup software for data integrity. The ability to recover data with the highest success rate is the goal.
